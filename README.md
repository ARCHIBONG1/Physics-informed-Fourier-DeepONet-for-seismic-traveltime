# Physics-informed-Fourier-DeepONet-for-seismic-traveltime
Seismic traveltime calculation based on the eikonal equation is fundamental to various geophysical applications. With advances in deep learning, **neural operators** now allow networks to learn general solutions to PDEs. In particular, **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** enable training supervised by physical laws rather than labeled data.

In this project, we propose **PI-Fourier-DeepONet**, a hybrid physics-informed neural operator that combines the **Deep Operator Network (DeepONet)** and the **Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)** to approximate seismic traveltimes in complex media. DeepONet captures the operator mapping between traveltime, the velocity model, and source location, while FNO enhances the model's ability to learn global patterns in the frequency domain。

We use the dataset provided by OpenFWI (https://github.com/lanl/OpenFWI) for testing.

PI-Fourier-DeepONet is capable of performing seismic traveltime simulation for different velocity models under the guidance of the eikonal equation. We use the Fast Marching Method (FMM) provided by scikit-fmm ([https://github.com/scikit-fmm/scikit-fmm](https://github.com/scikit-fmm/scikit-fmm)) as the baseline for comparison.

# Physics-informed and Data-driven comparison
People are often curious whether physics-informed training and data-driven models differ in terms of accuracy or generalization. Here, we compare the PI-Fourier-DeepONet with the Fourier-DeepONet trained on traveltime data generated by the FMM.

The following kernel density estimation (KDE) plots illustrate the error distributions of PI-Fourier-DeepONet and Fourier-DeepONet across four velocity families.
